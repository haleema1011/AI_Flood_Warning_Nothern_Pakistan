# AI-Based Flood Warning System for Northern Pakistan

This repository contains the code, data, and results for my final year thesis project titled:

**"AI-Based Flood Prediction in Mountainous Regions: Enhancing Early Warning Systems in Northern Pakistan."**

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict flood discharge in mountainous regions of Northern Pakistan. The system aims to support early flood warnings and improve disaster preparedness.

### 🌍 Study Area
- Region: **Northern Pakistan**, including the **Kabul River Basin**
- Data period: 2005–2020
- Focus: High-risk flood-prone areas with historical extreme events
